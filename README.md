With Verxio, creators/businesses can also offer NFTs and Token ownership-based discounts to achieve the following use case:

- Customers receive an NFT-based proof of purchase in place of receipts upon a successful purchase.
- Reward community, brand, or product loyal users based on their Token ($BONK) and NFT ownership.
- Enabling buy-to-redeem commerce by offering nearly 100% discounts to customers who hold $BONK tokens or the necessary NFTs.

Verxio's tokenized discount feature, creators and businesses can provide discounts to convert users and drive more sales, while also encouraging users to join their community.

## Bonk Integration & Overall Impact  üê∂
1. $BONK Payment: Verxio provides users with an innovative way to spend their $BONK on digital product purchases
   
2. $BONK Token ownership-based discounts: Creators can enable buy-to-redeem commerce by offering discounts ranging from 0% to 100% to customers who hold $BONK.

3. $BONK Cashback System: Creators can drive sales by incentivizing purchases with $BONK, encouraging repeat business, attracting new customers, and gaining a competitive edge.

4. $BONK Revenue Share: Customers who purchase items on Verxio will partake in a 50% revenue split shared based on the $BONK holdings of customers.

## Solana & Protocol Integrations ‚öôÔ∏è
1. Verxio is integrating [Underdog Protocol](https://www.underdogprotocol.com/) to create dynamic/soulbound NFTs, manage NFTs, and connect off-chain workflows, on-chain enabling on-chain marketing automation.
   
2. Verxio is building on [Candypay](https://candypay.fun/) to enable creators to accept Solana payments with our seamless, mobile native, NFT/ Token-ownership loyalty discount Checkout solution in minutes.

3. Verxio is also integrating [Pyth Network's](https://pyth.network/) oracle to pull in $BONK/USDC price feed which is used to calculate the $BONK equivalent that customers need to pay for their purchase

## Future Plans & Implementation üîÆ
1. Adding features for everything creators need to create, market, sell, and deliver their products online including:
   - Sales Pages
   - Product Funnels
   - Email Marketing
   - A/B Testing integrations
   - Workflows integration
   - APIs & Webhooks
   - CRM and other integrations
   - Community
2. A telegram bot that allows creators to create their NFT loyalty vouchers, upload their product to `Verxio`, obtain a product link to share and start selling their digital products, and accept instant payment with $BONK (or their preferred SPL token).
   
3. Build out the `Verxio` explore page where users and creator communities can discover products by several creators.
   
4. VexList which will be a collaborative social blacklist where users can share and openly dislike products/services they've had bad experiences with both on `Verxio` and generally while getting $BONK incentive rewards.
   
5. We're also looking to allow creators and businesses to integrate `Verxio` on some of the top eCommerce platforms like:
   - WooCommerce
   - Magento
   - BigCommerce
   - Wix
   - Squarespace
